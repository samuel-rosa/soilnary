Internationalization and localization are concepts developed in the field of computing refering to the 
adaptation of computer software to different languages and regional differences (read more about it in 
[Wikipedia][wiki]). For computer software developers, the goal is to make their software usable and accessible
to people that speak languages other than that with which the computer software has been documented.
