Production of up-to-date, high resolution global soil information seems to be gaining momentum. The Food and 
Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations (UN), through the Global Soil Partnership (GSP) project, 
along with many other national and international organizations, is working hard to convince decision and policy
makers, as well as the scientific community as a whole, of the importance of high quality soil information to 
deal with some of the major issues of our time. For that end, FAO has been supporting the implementation of 
joint efforts that could lead to the adoption of global development goals focused on the sustainable use of 
soil resources. The primary basis to reach this goal is soil data. However, as it has been identified by FAO, 
soil data is "*fragmented, partly outdated, heterogeneous and difficult to compare, not easily accessible, and 
not responding to users needs*", some of it under threat of being lost forever.

Multiple organizations have been working on the development of soil databases. Most of them focus on the 
national level, which is operationally easier than working at the regional or global levels due to the use
of standard procedures for soil description and analysis. Developing fully functional regional or global soil 
databases requires not only rescuing and collating legacy soil data -- that already is a very difficult task 
--, but also the difficult and tedious work of *standardization* and *harmonization*. Soil data standardization
and harmonization guarantee that a soil database can accommodate any soil data irrespective of its source, that
is, the method of sampling, description, analysis, classification, mapping, measurement units, and so on.

One of the few organizations working to rescue, collate and harmonize legacy soil profile description and
analytical data at the global level is ISRIC -- World Soil Information, accredited by the International 
Council of Science (ICSU) as the World Data Centre for Soils. Recently, ISRIC announced the World Soil
Information Service ([WoSIS](http://www.isric.org/data/wosis)), a centralized, user–focused, comprehensive and 
accessible database resulting from the compilation of some 98,000 profiles from around the world. All soil 
property data has been standardized with regard to soil property naming conventions and measurement units, as 
well as the description of analytical methods 
([Ribeiro et al, 2015](http://www.isric.org/sites/default/files/isric_report_2015_03.pdf)).

The next step consists of developing a new data centre that will feature improved viewing and sharing of the 
soil profile data contained in WoSIS.
