**Internationalization** and **localization** are concepts developed in the field of computing refering to the 
adaptation of computer software to different languages and regional differences. Like for computer software 
developers, soil database developers aim at making their product usable and accessible to people that speak 
languages other than that with which the computer software or the soil database has been written and 
documented.

The material organised in this repository is the result of a collaborative effort to help soil scientists and 
soil database developers internationalizing and localizing their databases.
