292	Gelisols and Gelic suborders and great groups that have a mean annual soil temperature from -4 °C to -10 °C.							
293	"Soils in this temperature regime have a mean annual temperature lower than 8 °C but do not have permafrost (Gr. kryos, coldness; meaning very cold soils).

1. In mineral soils the mean summer soil temperature (June, July, and August in the Northern Hemisphere and December, January, and February in the Southern Hemisphere) either at a depth of 50 cm from the soil surface or at a densic, lithic, or paralithic contact, whichever is shallower, is as follows:
a. If the soil is not saturated with water during some part of the summer and
  (1) If there is no O horizon: lower than 15 °C; or
  (2) If there is an O horizon: lower than 8 °C; or
b. If the soil is saturated with water during some part of the summer and
  (1) If there is no O horizon: lower than 13 °C; or
  (2) If there is an O horizon or a histic epipedon: lower than 6 °C.

2. In organic soils the mean annual soil temperature is lower than 6 °C. Cryic soils that have an aquic moisture regime commonly are churned by frost. Isofrigid soils could also have a cryic temperature regime. A few with organic materials in the upper part are exceptions."							
294	A soil with a frigid temperature regime is warmer in summer than a soil with a cryic regime, but its mean annual temperature is lower than 8 °C and the difference between mean summer (June, July, and August) and mean winter (December, January, and February) soil temperatures is more than 6 °C either at a depth of 50 cm from the soil surface or at a densic, lithic, or paralithic contact, whichever is shallower.							
295	The mean annual soil temperature is lower than 8 °C. The mean summer and mean winter soil temperatures differ by less than 6 °C at a depth of 50 cm or at a densic, lithic, or paralithic contact, whichever is shallower.							
296								
297	The mean annual soil temperature is 8 °C or higher but lower than 15 °C, and the difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperatures is more than 6 °C either at a depth of 50 cm from the soil surface or at a densic, lithic, or paralithic contact, whichever is shallower.							
298	"The mean annual soil temperature is 8 °C or higher but lower than 15 °C.
The mean summer and mean winter soil temperatures differ by less than 6 °C at a depth of 50 cm or at a densic, lithic, or paralithic contact, whichever is shallower."							
299	The mean annual soil temperature is 15 °C or higher but lower than 22 °C, and the difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperatures is more than 6 °C either at a depth of 50 cm from the soil surface or at a densic, lithic, or paralithic contact, whichever is shallower.

313	No essential elements are missing from the description, sampling or analysis. The number of samples collected is sufficient to characterize all major soil horizons, but may not allow precise definition of all subhorizons, especially in the deeper soil. The profile depth is 80 cm or more, or down to a C or R horizon or layer, which may be shallower. Additional augering and sampling may be required for lower level classification.

747	Usually thick (5–30 cm) organic matter accumulation that is largely unaltered owing to lack of decomposers. This kind of organic matter layer develops in extremely nutrient-poor and coarsetextured soils under vegetation that produces a litter layer that is difficult to decompose. It is usually a sequence of Oi–Oe–Oa layers over a thin A horizon, easy to separate one layer from another and being very acid with a C/N ratio of > 29.							
748								
749	More decomposed than raw humus but characterized by an organic matter layer on top of the mineral soil with a diffuse boundary between the organic matter layer and A horizon. In the sequence of Oi–Oe–Oa layers, it is difficult to separate one layer from another. This develops in moderately nutrient-poor conditions, usually under a cool moist climate. It is usually acidic with a C/N ratio of 18–29.							
750	characterized by the periodic absence of organic matter accumulation on the surface owing to the rapid decomposition process and mixing of organic matter and the mineral soil material by bioturbation. It is usually slightly acid to neutral with a C/N ratio of 10–18.

1058	Level lands are all lands with dominant slopes between 0 and 8% (0° and 4°40'). Moreover, the relief intensity is such that the difference between the highest and the lowest point within one slope unit is mostly less than 50 m. 1st level landform.							
1059	Plains are all level lands that are not enclosed between higher lying lands, that do not protrude above the surrounding country, or that do not rise gently against land with a considerable steeper slope. 2nd level landform.							
1060	Plateaux are level lands that are, compared with the surrounding landscapes, situated at relatively elevated positions. Plateau can be very extensive, but must always on at least one side be bounded by a slope or escarpment (8% ore more), connecting it with lower lying land. Many so-called plateaux are in fact elevated plains, and should be classified as such. 2nd level landform.							
1061	A large tract of level land, surrounded on all sides by high, rising sloping or steep land, is characterized as a major depression. Uvalas are typical for this group. 2nd level landform.							
1062	A depression is an area of level land that is on all sides surrounded by higher lying level or sloping land. The area occupied by the band of sloping land that forms the transition from the higher ground to the floor of the depression is small compared to the area within the depression taken up by level land. 2nd level landform.							
1063	Steadily rising level land, abutting strongly sloping or steep lands, are classified as low level footslopes. They merge into other types of level land, including low gradient footslopes that rise in an opposite direction. Pediments, (coalescing) alluvial fans and other similar landforms can all be considered low level footslopes. Footslopes with a higher gradient than 8% are accommodated under hills, as such slopes are usually incised to the extent that they take a hilly character. 2nd level landform.							
1064	Elongated strips of level land, on both sides flanked by areas with sloping or steep land, constitute valley floors. Valley floors normally taper off at one end, where they are embraced by steeper land on three sides. They may connect with other types of level land or sloping land at the other end. In mountainous areas valley floors can be surrounded on all sides by steep lands, and do not necessarily have to be elongated. 2nd level landform.							
1065								
1066								
1067	Sloping land embraces all landforms that have dominant slopes between 8% and 30%, combined with in most cases a relief intensity of more than 50 m per slope unit. In general, sloping land will be more heterogeneous with respect to its slope than level land. 1st level landform.							
1068	Relatively gently sloping (15-30% gradient) mountains with a local relief intensity of more than 600 m. Many volcanoes will fall into this category, as do several foothill zones of major mountain systems. 2nd level landform.							
1069	All sloping land with an undulating relief (minimum relief intensity 50 m per slope unit), not elongated, or more than 600 m high, or incorporated in mountainous terrain, are considered hills. This group does not only include hilly landforms, but also accommodates other landforms such as medium-gradient footslopes, etc. 2nd level landform.							
1070	Relatively gently sloping (usually 15-30% gradient) zone that forms a transition between high and low lying country. The local relief intensity of this landform is normally less than 600 m/2 km. 2nd level landform.							
1071	A ridge meets all the qualifications of medium-gradient hills, but has an elongated shape with a single crest, which may have a more or less constant elevation, or may contain a number of peaks. Relatively narrow plateaus are excluded from this landform group. 2nd level landform.							
1072	Land which, although forming part of a mountain range (slopes of more than 30% and relief intensities in excess of 600 m per 2 km), constitute a restricted zone with less steep slopes and subdued relief. Mountainous highland always forms part of a mountain system, and is thus on at least at one side bounded by high-gradient mountains. Hypsometric subdivision of this category is according to the qualifiers for steep lands. 2nd level landform.							
1073	Sloping land with a more or less constant crest level, and relief intensities of less than 50 m per slope unit. 2nd level landform.							
1074	Steep land is mainly confined to mountainous country, where average slopes are over 30% (the variability of slope gradients may be so much as to make it difficult to recognize a dominant slope) and the relief intensity is more than 600 m/2 km. 1st level landform.							
1075	All steep land with a relief intensity of more than 600 m  per 2 km, and surrounding one or more outstanding peaks. 2nd level landform.							
1076	Steep but low relief land (relief intensity of less than 600 m per 2 km). Badlands would be a landform taken care of by this group, which is hypsometrically subdivided according to the qualifiers for sloping land. 2nd level landform.							
1077	Steep land that forms the transition between high and low lying country and lacks outstanding peaks. The relief intensity is normally more than 600 m per 2 km. 2nd level landform.							
1078	Very steep valleys, with normally very little valley floor. No height limit is given, as the lack of valley floor and the presence of steep slopes ensure that only deep valleys will cover sufficient area to produce mappable delineations. Mostly incised elevated sedimentary plateaux. 2nd level landform.							
1079	Landforms, containing both level and steep or sloping land, which cannot be separated at the scale of the mapping, are considered composite landforms. Composite landforms are using hypsometric qualifiers according to the characteristics of their level part. 1st level landform.							
1080	The valley, made up of sideslopes and a valley bottom, is taken as one landform. 2nd level landform.							
1081	A narrow strip of level land surrounded on all sides by sloping or steep falling land form together a narrow plateau. 2nd level landform.

1199								
1200	Water drains slowly, but most of the terrain does not remain waterlogged for more than 30 days continuously.							
1201	Water drains well but not excessively, nowhere does the terrain remain waterlogged for a continuous period of more than 48 hours.							
1202	Excess water drains rapidly, even during periods of prolonged rainfall.							
1203	Excess water drains very rapidly, the terrain does not support growth of short rooted plants even if there is sufficient rainfall.

1220	Weakly decomposed organic soil material (fibre content >2/3 of volume).							
1221	Degree of decomposition intermediate between fibric and sapric (fibre content between 1/6 and 2/3 of volume).							
1222	Highly decomposed organic soil material (fibre content <1/6 of volume).							
1223	An horizon which is more than 20 cm but less than 40 cm thick. It can be more than 40 cm but less than 60 cm thick if it consists of 75 percent or more, by volume, of sphagnum fibres or has a bulk density when moist of less than 0.1 kg.dm-3. A surface layer less than 25 cm thick qualifies as a histic horizon if, after having been mixed to a depth of 25 cm, it has 16% or more organic carbon and the mineral fraction contains more than 60% clay, or 8% or more organic carbon for intermediate contents of clay.							
1224	"A horizon with the following properties for the upper 18 cm: 
1) the soil structure is sufficiently strong that the horizon is not both massive and hard or very hard when dry. Very coarse prisms larger than 30 cm in diameter are included in the meaning of massive if there is no secondary structure within the prisms.
2) the chroma is less than 3.5 when moist, the value darker than 3.5 when moist and 5.5 when dry; the colour value is at least one unit darker than that of the C (both moist and dry). If a C horizon is not present, comparison should be made with the horizon immediately underlying the A horizon. If there is more than 40% finely divided lime, the limits of the colour value dry are waived; the colour value moist should then be 5 or less.
3) the base saturation (by NH4OAc) is 50% or more
4) the organic carbon content is at least 0.6% throughout the thickness of mixed soil, as specified below. It is at least petrocalcic or a petrogypsic horizon or a petroferric phase."							
1225	A man made surface layer 50 cm or more thick which has been produced by long continued manuring with earthy mixtures. If a fimic horizon meets the requirements of the mollic or umbric horizon, it is distinguished from it by an acid-extractable P2O5 content which is higher than 250 mg.kg-1 soil by 1 percent citric acid. Examples are the plaggen epipedon and the anthropic epipedon of Soil Taxonomy.							
1226	Comparable to mollic in colour, organic carbon and phosphorus content, consistency, structure and thickness. However, the base saturation is less than 50%.							
1227	The horizon is too light in colour, has too high a chroma, too little organic carbon, or is too thin to be a mollic or umbric, or is both hard and massive when dry. Finely stratified materials do not qualify as an ochric horizon, e.g. surface layers of fresh alluvial deposits.							
1228	A subsurface horizon which has a distinctly higher clay content than the overlying horizon. This difference may be due to an illuvial accumulation of clay, or to a destruction of clay in the surface horizon, or to a selective surface erosion of clay, or to biological activity or to a combination of two or more of these different processes. Sedimentation of surface materials, which are coarser than the subsurface horizon, may enhance a pedogenic textural differentiation. However, a mere lithological discontinuity, such as may occur in alluvial deposits, does not qualify as an argic horizon. When an argic horizon is formed by clay illuviation, clay skins may occur on ped surfaces, in fissures, in pores, and in channels. The texture must be sandy loam or finer with at least 8% clay.							
1229	"An argic horizon with 
1) a columnar or prismatic structure in some part of the horizon, or a blocky structure with tongues of an eluvial horizon in which there are uncoated silt or sand grains extending more than 2.5 cm into the horizon, and 
2) an exchangeable sodium percentage of more than 15% within the upper 40 cm of the horizon; or more exchangeable magnesium plus sodium than calcium plus exchange acidity within the upper 40 cm of the horizon if the saturation with exchangeable sodium is more than 15% in some subhorizon within 200 cm of the surface."							
1230	An altered horizon lacking properties that meet the requirements of an argic, natric or spodic horizon	 lacking the dark colours, organic matter content and structure of the histic horizon, or the mollic and umbric horizons. The texture is sandy loam or finer, with at least 8% of clay	 the thickness is at least 15 cm with the lower depth at least 25 cm below the surface	 soil structure is at least moderately developed or rock structure is absent in at least half the volume of the horizon	 the CEC is more than 160 mmolc kg-1 clay, or the content of weatherable minerals in the 0.050 to 0.200 mm fraction is 10% or more	 the horizon shows alteration in a) stronger chroma, redder hue, or higher clay content than the underlying horizon, or b) evidence of removal of carbonates, or c) if carbonates are absent in the parent material and in the dust that falls on the soil, the required evidence of alteration is satisfied by the presence of soil structure and the absence of rock structure in more than 50% of the horizon	 shows no cementation, induration or brittle consistence when moist.	
1231	"A spodic horizon meets one of the following requirements below a depth of 12.5 cm:
1) a subhorizon more than 2.5 cm thick that is continuously cemented by a combination of organic matter with iron and/or aluminium
2) a sandy or coarse-loamy texture with distinct dark pellets of coarse silt size or larger or with sand grains covered with cracked coatings which consist of organic matter and aluminium with or without iron.
3) one or more subhorizons in which a) if there is 0.1% or more extractable iron, the ratio of iron plus Al extractable by pyrophosphate at pH 10 to clay% is 0.2 or more, or if there is less than 0.1% extractable iron, the ratio of Al plus organic carbon to clay is 0.2 or more; and b) the sum of pyrophosphate-extractable Fe+Al is half or more of the sum of dithionite-citrate extractable Fe+Al; and c) the thickness is such that the index of accumulation of amorphous material in the subhorizons that meet the preceding requirements is 65 or more. This index is calculated by subtracting half the clay% from CEC at pH 8.2 mmolc kg-1 clay and multiplying the remainder by the thickness of the subhorizon in cm. The results of all subhorizons are then added."							
1232	The ferralic horizon has a texture that is sandy loam or finer with at least 8% of clay	 is at least 30 cm thick	 has a CEC equal to or less than 160 mmolc kg-1 clay or has an effective CEC equal to or less than 120 mmolc kg-1 clay (sum of NH4OAc exchangeable bases plus 1M KCl-exchangeable acidity)	 has less than 10% weatherable minerals in the 0.050 to 0.200 mm fraction	 has less than 10% water-dispersible clay	 has a silt clay ratio which is 0.2 or less	 does not have andic properties	 has less than 5% by volume showing rock structure.
1233	Soil material that has 30% or more clay, has a moderately strong angular blocky structure which falls easily apart into flat edged ('polyhedric' or 'nutty') elements which show shiny ped faces that are either thin clay coatings or pressure faces. This soil structure is apparently associated with the presence of significant amounts of active iron oxides and is indicative of a high effective moisture storage and favourable phosphate sorption - desorption properties.							
1234	A horizon of accumulation of calcium carbonate. The horizon is enriched with secondary calcium carbonate over a thickness of 15 cm or more, has a calcium carbonate content of 15% or more and at least 5% greater than that of a deeper horizon. The latter requirement is expressed by volume if the secondary carbonates in the calcic horizon occur as pendants on pebbles, or as concretions or soft powdery forms. If such a calcic horizon rests on very calcareous materials (40% or more calcium carbonate equivalent), the percentage of carbonates need not decrease with depth.							
1235	A continuous cemented or indurated calcic horizon, cemented by calcium carbonate and in places by calcium and some magnesium carbonate. Accessory silica may be present. The petrocalcic horizon is continuously cemented to the extent that dry fragments do not slake in water and roots cannot enter. It is massive or platy, extremely hard when dry so that it cannot be penetrated by spade or auger, and very firm to extremely firm when moist. Non-capillary pores are filled	 hydraulic conductivity is moderately slow to very slow. It is usually thicker than 10 cm.						
1236	The gypsic horizon is enriched with secondary calcium sulphate (CaSO4.2H2O), is 10 cm or more thick, has at least 5% more gypsum than the underlying horizon, and the product of the thickness (cm) and the percent of gypsum is 150 or more.							
1237	A gypsic horizon that is so cemented with gypsum that dry fragments do not slake in water and roots cannot enter. The gypsum content usually exceeds 60%.							
1238	The sulphuric horizon forms as a result of artificial drainage and oxidation of mineral or organic materials which are rich in sulphides. It is at least 15 cm thick and characterized by a pH H2O less than 3.5 and generally has jarosite mottles with a hue of 2.5Y or more and a chroma of 6 or more.							
1239	Clay and free iron oxides have been removed, or the oxides have been segregated to the extent that the colour of the horizon is determined by the colour of the primary sand and silt particles rather than by coatings of these particles. An albic horizon has a colour value moist of 4 or more, or a value dry of 5 or more, or both. If the value dry is 7 or more, or the value moist is 6 or more, the chroma is 3 or less. If the value dry is 5 or 6, or the value moist 4 or 5, the chroma is closer to 2 than to 3. If the parent materials have a hue of 5YR or redder, a chroma moist of 3 is permitted in the albic horizon where the chroma is due to the colour of uncoated silt or sand grains.							
1240	A clay increase between two layers, which takes place over a distance of less than 5 cm, where the lower layer shows a clay content of twice the clay content of the overlying layer if the latter has less than 20% clay, or an increase of 20% or more if the latter has 20% clay or more.							
1241	Soil material with an organic carbon content of more than 14 g/kg fine earth as a weighted average over a depth of 100 cm from the surface. This calculation assumes a bulk density of 1.5 kg dm-3.							
1242	Tropical rainy climates	 temperature of the coolest month above 18°C. With monthly temperatures lower than 18°C certain sensitive tropical plants do not thrive. This is the realm of plants known as megatherms which need continuously high temperatures and relatively abundant precipitation. Within the A group of climates two main types are recognized, Af and Aw.						
1243								
1244	Soil materials which meet one or more of the following requirements: 1) acid oxalate extractable Al plus 1/2 acid oxalate extractable Fe is 2.0% or more in the fine earth fraction; bulk density of the fine earth fraction, measured in the field moist state, is 0.9 kg dm-3 or less; phosphate retention is more than 85%. 2) more than 60% by volume of the whole soil is volcani-clastic material coarser than 2 mm; acid oxalate extractable Al plus 1/2 acid oxalate extractable Fe is 0.40% or more in the fine earth fraction. 3) the 0.02 to 2.0 mm fraction is at least 30% of the fine earth fraction and meets one of the following: a) if the fine earth fraction has acid oxalate extractable Al plus 1/2 acid oxalate extractable Fe of 0.40% or less, there is at least 30% volcanic glass in the 0.02 to 2.0 mm fraction; or b) if the fine earth fraction has acid oxalate extractable Al plus 1/2 acid oxalate extractable Fe of 2.0% or more, there is at least 5% volcanic glass in the 0.02 to 2.0 mm fraction; or c) if the fine earth fraction has acid oxalate extractable Al plus 1/2 acid oxalate extractable Fe of between 0.40 and 2.0%, there is a proportional content of volcanic glass in the 0.02 to 2.0 mm fraction between 30 and 5%.							
1245	Soil material which shows strong effervescence with 10% HCl or which contains more than 2% calcium carbonate equivalent.							
1246	Soils which are calcareous throughout the depth between 20 and 50 cm.							
1247	The underlying material is sufficiently coherent and hard when moist tomake hand digging with a spade impractable. The material is continuous except for a few cracks produced in place without significant displacement of the pieces and horizontally distant to an average of 10 cm or more. The material considered here does not include subsurface horizons such as a duripan, a petrocalcic or a petrogypsic horizon or a petroferric phase.							
1248	The term 'ferralic properties' is used in connection with Cambisols and Arenosols which have a CEC of less than 240 mmolc kg-1 clay or less than 40 mmolc kg-1 soil in at least one subhorizon of the cambic horizon or the horizon immediately underlying the A horizon.							
1249	Many coarse mottles with hues redder than 7.5YR or chromas more than 5 or both	 discrete nodules, up to 2 cm in diameter, the exteriors of the nodules being enriched and weakly cemented or indurated with Fe and having redder hues or stronger chromas than the interiors (Luvisols, Alisols, Lixisols and Acrisols).						
1250	Fluviatile, marine and lacustrine sediments, which receive fresh materials at regular intervals, and which, unless empoldered, have one or both of the following properties: 1) an organic carbon content that decreases irregularly with depth or that remains above 0.20% to a depth of 125 cm. Thin strata of sand may have less organic carbon if the finer sediments below, exclusive of buried horizons, meet the requirement	 2) stratification in at least 25% of the soil within 125 cm of the surface.						
1251	Soil materials which have either: 1) 1.5 cmolc kg-1 clay or less  exchangeable bases (Ca, Mg, K, Na) plus unbuffered 1M KCl exchangeable acidity	 or 2) a delta pH (pH KCl minus pH H2O) of +0.1 or more.						
1252	Soil materials which are saturated with water at some period of the year, or throughout the year, in most years, and which show evidence of  reduction processes or of reduction and segregation of iron.							
1253	Soil material which contains 5% or more gypsum.							
1254	Penetrations of an albic horizon into an underlying argic or natric horizon along ped faces, primarily vertical faces. The penetrations are not wide enough to constitute tonguing, but form continuous skeletans (ped coatings of clean silt or sand, more than 1 mm thick on the vertical ped faces).							
1255	Organic soil materials are: 1) saturated with water for long periods or are artificially drained and, excluding live roots, a) have 18% or more organic carbon if the mineral fraction is 60% or more clay, b) have 12% or more organic carbon if the mineral fraction has no clay, or c) have a proportional content of organic carbon between 12 and 18% if the clay content of the mineral fraction is less than 60%	 or 2) never saturated with water for more than a few days and have 20% or more organic carbon.						
1256	Permafrost is a layer in which the temperature is perennially at or below 0oC.							
1257	Plinthite is an iron-rich, humus-poor mixture of clay with quartz and other diluents. It commonly occurs as red mottles, usually in platy, polygonal or reticulate patterns, and changes irreversibly to a hardpan or to irregular aggregates on exposure to repeated wetting and drying. In a moist soil, plinthite is usually firm but it can be cut with a spade. When irreversibly hardened the material is no longer considered plinthite. Such hardened material is shown as a petroferric or a skeletic phase.							
1258	The electric conductivity of the saturation extract is more than 15 dS m-1 within 30 cm of the surface, or more than 4 dS m-1 within 30 cm of the surface if the pH-H2O exceeds 8.5.							
1259	Slickensides are polished and grooved surfaces that are produced by one mass sliding past another. Some of them occur at the base of a slip surface where a mass of soil moves downward on a relatively steep slope. Slickensides are very common in swelling clays in which there are marked seasonal changes in moisture content.							
1260	Thixotropic soil material	 it changes under pressure or by rubbing from a plastic solid into a liquefied stage and back to the solid condition. In the liquefied stage the material skids or smears between the fingers (Andosols).

1262	Translocated authigenic lime, soft enough to be cut readily with finger powdery nail, precipitated in place from the soil solution rather than inherited from a soil parent material. It should be present in a significant accumulation (coatings on pores or structural faces).							
1263								
1264								
1265	Sulphidic materials are waterlogged mineral or organic soil materials containing 0.75% or more sulphur (dry weight), mostly in the form of sulphides, having less than three times as much calcium carbonate equivalent as sulphur, and having a pH above 3.5. Sulphidic materials accumulate in a soil that is permanently saturated and having a pH above 3.5, generally with brackish water. If the soil is drained the sulphides oxidize to form sulphuric acid. The pH, which is normally near neutrality before drainage, drops below 3.5. At this point these materials become a sulphuric horizon. Sulphidic material differs from the sulphuric horizon in its reduced condition, its pH and the absence of jarosite mottles with a hue of 2.5Y or more or a chroma of 6 or more.							
1266	An albic horizon penetrates an argic horizon along ped surfaces, if peds are present. Tongues must have greater depth than width, have horizontal dimensions of 5 mm or more in fine textured argic horizons (clay, silty clay and sandy clay), 10 mm or more in moderately fine textured argic horizons, and 15 mm or more in medium or coarser textured argic horizons (silt loams, loams and sandy loams), and must occupy more than 15% of the mass of the upper part of the argic horizon.							
1267	In connection with clayey soils which at some period in most years show one or more of the following: cracks, slickensides, wedge-shaped or parallelepiped structural aggregates, that are not in a combination, or are not sufficiently expressed, for the soils to qualify as Vertisols.							
1268	Minerals included are those that are unstable in a humid climate relative to other minerals, such as quartz and 1:1 lattice clays, and that, when weathering occurs, liberate plant nutrients and iron or aluminium. They include: 1) clay minerals: all 2:1 lattice clays except aluminium-interlayered chlorite. Sepiolite, talc and glauconite are also included in the meaning of this group of weatherable clay minerals, although they are not always of clay size. 2) silt- and sand-size minerals: feldspars, feldspathoids, ferromagnesian minerals, glasses, micas, and zeolites.							
1269	No observable aggregation or no orderly arrangement of natural planes of weakness (massive or single grain).							
1270	Soil with poorly formed indistinct peds, that are barely observable in place even in dry soil, breaks up into very few intact peds, many broken peds and much apedal material.							
1271	Soil with well-formed distinct peds, durable and evident in disturbed soil which produces many entire peds, some broken peds and little apedal material.							
1272	Soil with durable peds that are clearly evident in undisturbed (dry) soil, which breaks up mainly into entire peds.							
1273	Ranges of size of structure elements (mm): platy < 1, prismatic/columnar < 10, (sub)angular blocky < 5, granular < 1, crumb < 1.							
1274	Ranges of size of structure elements (mm): platy 1-2, prismatic/columnar 10-20, (sub)angular blocky 5-10, granular 1-2, crumb 1-2.

This is the realm of plants known as megatherms which need continuously high temperatures and relatively abundant precipitation. Within the A group of climates two main types are recognized. The f type (Af) represents a tropical wet climate	 rainfall of the driest month is at least 60 mm. Within this climate there is a minimum of seasonal variation in temperature and precipitation, both remaining high throughout the year.

Within the A group of climates two main types are recognized, Af and Aw. Type As denotes a climate with a dry season during a high-sun period (rare).						
1303	Tropical rainy climates	 temperature of the coolest month above 18°C. With monthly temperatures lower than 18°C certain sensitive tropical plants do not thrive. This is the realm of plants known as megatherms which need continuously high temperatures and relatively abundant precipitation. Within the A group of climates two main types are recognized. The w type (Aw) represents a tropical wet-and-dry climate	 distinct dry season in low-sun period or winter. A marked seasonal rhythm of rinfall characterizes Aw climates: at least one month must have less than 60 mm. Temperature is similar to that in Af, i.e. with aminimum of seasonal variation, remaining high throughout the year.					
1304	Dry climate, in which there is an excess of evaporation over precipitation. No surplus of water remains, therefore, to maintain a constant groundwater level so that permanent streams cannot originate within B climates. The amount of precipitation that falls is not sufficient data with which to determine the B climate boundaries, since the effectiveness of precipitation in providing moisture in the ground for plants is dependent upon the rate of evaporation, which in turn varies directly with temperature. Rain that falls during a hot summer obviously is less effective than the same amount falling in a cool winter. Köppen's formulas for identifying arid and semi-arid climates, therefore, involve not only the annual temoerature and the total annual rainfall, but likewise the season of maximum precipitation. Type BS, a semi-arid climate or steppe, is one of the two main subdivisions of B climates. The suffix 'h' in BWk denotes an average annual temperature over 18°C.

1530	Dry climate, in which there is an excess of evaporation over precipitation. No surplus of water remains, therefore, to maintain a constant groundwater level so that permanent streams cannot originate within B climates. The amount of precipitation that falls is not sufficient data with which to determine the B climate boundaries, since the effectiveness of precipitation in providing moisture in the ground for plants is dependent upon the rate of evaporation, which in turn varies directly with temperature. Rain that falls during a hot summer obviously is less effective than the same amount falling in a cool winter. Köppen's formulas for identifying arid and semi-arid climates, therefore, involve not only the annual temoerature and the total annual rainfall, but likewise the season of maximum precipitation. Type BW, an arid climate or desert, is one of the two main subdivisions of B climates. The suffix 'k' in BWk denotes an average annual temperature under 18°C.							
1531	Mild temperate rainy (mesothermal) climates	 average temperature of the coldest month below 18°C but above -3°C.	 average temperature of warmest month over 10°C. The average temperature of -3°C for the coldest month supposedly roughly coincides with the equatorward limit of frozen ground and a snow cover lasting for a month or more. Within the C group of climates three contrasting rainfall regimes are the basis for recognition of three principal climate types. The Cf type has no distinc dry season	 difference between the rainiest and driest months is less than for the other two types, and the driest month of summer receives more than 30 mm. The suffix 'a' in Cfa denotes a hot summer with an average temperature of the warmest month over 22°C.

2225	Mild temperate rainy (mesothermal) climates	 average temperature of the coldest month below 18°C but above -3°C.	 average temperature of warmest month over 10°C. The average temperature of -3°C for the coldest month supposedly roughly coincides with the equatorward limit of frozen ground and a snow cover lasting for a month or more. Within the C group of climates three contrasting rainfall regimes are the basis for recognition of three principal climate types. The Cw type has a dry winter	 at least ten times as much rain in the wettest month of summer as in the driest month of winter. This type of climate has two characteristic locations: (1) elevated sites in the low latitudes where altitude reduces the temperature of the Aw climates which prevail in the adjacent lowlands, and (2) mild middle-latitude monsoon lands of southeastern Asia, particularly Northern India and Southern China.

2230	Cold snow-forest climates	 average temperature of coldest month below -3°C, average temperature of warmest month above 10°C. The average temperature of 10°C for the warmest month approximately coincides with the poleward limits of forest. D climates are characterized by frozen ground and a snow cover of several months' duration. Two principal subdivisions of the D group are recognized, Df and Dw. The Df type is a cold climate with humid winters.						
2231	Cold snow-forest climates	 average temperature of coldest month below -3°C, average temperature of warmest month above 10°C. The average temperature of 10°C for the warmest month approximately coincides with the poleward limits of forest.

The Ds type has a dry summer	 at least three times as much rain in the wettest month of winter as as in the driest month of summer, and the driest month of summer receives less than 30 mm.					
2232	Aggregates are barely observable in place and there is only a weak arrangement of natural surfaces of weakness. When gently disturbed, the soil material breaks into a mixture of few entire aggregates, many broken aggregates, and much material without aggregate faces. Aggregate surfaces differ in some way from the aggregate interior.							
2233	Aggregates are observable in place and there is a distinct arrangement of natural surfaces of weakness. When disturbed, the soil material breaks into a mixture of many entire aggregates, some broken aggregates, and little material without aggregates faces. Aggregates surfaces generally show distinct differences with the aggregates interiors.							
2234	Aggregates are clearly observable in place and there is a prominent arrangement of natural surfaces of weakness. When disturbed, the soil material separates mainly into entire aggregates. Aggregates surfaces generally differ markedly from aggregate interiors.
